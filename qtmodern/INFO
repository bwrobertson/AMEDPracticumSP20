In order to use ``qtmodern``, simply apply the style you want to your
application and then, create a ``ModernWindow`` enclosing the window you want to
*modernize*::

    import qtmodern.styles
    import qtmodern.windows

    ...

    app = QApplication()
    win = YourWindow()

    qtmodern.styles.dark(app)
    mw = qtmodern.windows.ModernWindow(win)
    mw.show()

    ...
